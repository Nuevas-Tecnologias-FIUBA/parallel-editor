Parallel Editor
===============
A real-time colaborative tool to develop files over the network.

Installation
============
To try out the brand new Parallel Eclipse Plugin for Eclipse Helios (3.6) add the following
update-site URL to the 'Install new Software' window in Eclipse:

http://maurociancio.github.com/parallel-editor/update-site/

and select the Parallel Editor Plugin.

The plugin is currently in version 0.0.1.beta1.

Basic Usage
===========
The plugin adds a contextual menu to your text editor under the name 'Share thru PE'.
It allows to create a local share or to connect to a remote server. It can share
any type of text editor including .java files.

It also adds two views that can be found in window/show view. The category for these
views is Parallel Editor. The two views are: Share and Chat. The first one
allows you to control your shares and remote connectiones while the second one
allows you to chat your partners connected to your servers.

Feedback is appreciated.
Thanks.
